User Story
1.
As a Web Development Student,
I was challenged to make a Task Management/To-Do-List App
So that I can become a better web developer

2.
Given the app displays the task after I add them in the task input
The task appears on the left side one i complete the completed task shows on the right side
Allowing users to keep track of not only current but past task as well
